# How to deploy on local
We are using docker compose and a custom shell script to startup both components necessary for the zonemanager.

## Prerequisites:
- docker version that already includes "compose"

## How to run:
run the deploy.sh script with a normal shell. zsh has been tested, but bash and others should also work. Example:

`sh ./deployment/local/deploy.sh`

If you want to also build the containers run it as:

`sh ./deployment/local/deploy.sh build`

The script will ask you to paste the API key generated by the NSD container. you can find this by running:

`docker logs zonemanager-nsd`

enter the api key into the script, and it will startup the zonemanager ui. To verify everything started up fine, visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost8080)
