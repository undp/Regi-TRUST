# Regi-TRUST Phase 2 - Train Trust Framework Manager: Example Trust Lists

## Trust Lists

Train Trust Framework Manager - TFM, is the [TRAIN](#about-train) component that provides Trust Framework and Trust List provisioning and management. The Phase 2 repository contains the Trust List implementations patterned specifically for this phase of the Regi-TRUST registry.

Regi-TRUST Trust Lists are XML documents whose structure and properties are inspired by ETSI TS 119 612 compliant Trust Lists. Regi-TRUST and TRAIN's TFM represent the evolution of trust frameworks and trust lists to support cryptographically agnostic, distributed operating environments and extensible service definitions.
