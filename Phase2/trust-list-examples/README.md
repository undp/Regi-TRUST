# Regi-TRUST Phase 2 - Trust List Examples

## Trust Framework Manager and Trust Lists

The Trust Framework Manager - TFM, is the [TRAIN](#about-train) component that provides Trust Framework and Trust List provisioning and management. The Phase 2 repository contains the Trust List implementations patterned specifically for this phase of the Regi-TRUST registry work.

Regi-TRUST Trust Lists are XML documents whose structure and properties are inspired by ETSI TS 119 612 compliant Trust Lists. Regi-TRUST and TRAIN's TFM represent an evolution of trust frameworks and trust lists to support cryptographically agnostic, federated registry environments and registry tailored service definitions. 

## NOTE: The examples provided DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL service provider or service definitions.
